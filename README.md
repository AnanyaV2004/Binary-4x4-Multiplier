# Binary-4x4-Multiplier
Design of a 4x4 Multiplier to estimate leakage current/power for all input combinations and
propagation delays for all possible arc including critical path. Contains design the layout of the
multiplier, clearly indicating the location of each standard cell in the design. Also contains the comparison of pre and post-layout results. 
Verifies the funtionality of the multiplier in HDL. 

Below figure shown for reference.

**Following EDA tools are used:**
- *NG-SPICE for circuit design*
- *Magic for layout*
- *Verilog HDL design*
